# Building My Portfolio with Claude Code

*This post is coming soon. I'm documenting the full build process as I go.*

Topics I'll cover:
- How I structured the project spec and handed it to Claude Code
- The prompting workflow that worked (and what didn't)
- Architecture decisions made collaboratively with an AI
- Performance and accessibility from the start
- Lessons for developers building with Claude Code as a daily driver
